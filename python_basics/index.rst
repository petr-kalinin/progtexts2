Basics of Python
================

This section stands out from the rest of the notes. It describes
not algorithms, but the very basics of Python programming.
The section was added not because it is necessary for learning further material 
(in general, all algorithms don't depend on a specific language, therefore 
it's not necessary to know Python in order to study algorithms; on the other hand,
further sections require more basic knowledge than given in this section).
The section was added primarily because I still write notes about Python 
for my `algorithms course <https://algoprog.ru>`_ 
and it's convenient to have a unified place to refer to.

Therefore, in particular, the text is addressed to the students studying on my course.
