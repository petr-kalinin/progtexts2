Loops
=====

In programs, it is quite common that you have to repeat some operation(s) 
several times. Often you don't even know in advance how many times you exactly need 
to do it. There is a lanugage construction designed specially for this, called loop.

There are two types of loops in Python.

(I will give some code samples here. Of course, explore them
for a better comprehension.)

While loop
----------

The ``while`` loop is the simplest version of the loop. It performs some
operations and then determines whether they need to be performed again.
"Determination" is done by checking the condition set by the programmer.
The code looks like this:

::

    while condition:
        code

Here ``condition`` is a condition that has the same form as a condition for 
the ``if``-statement. There can be reraltions, ``and``, ``or``, etc.

And the ``code`` is an arbitrary sequence of operations (it can take
several lines) containing any instructions that you know or will
learn later: assignments, conditional statements, other loops, etc.

What will the computer do when it encounters such a loop? First it
will check if the condition is true. If it is, the computer
will execute the indented code below and check the condition again. If it is still
true, the computer will execute that code again. And so on, until 
the next check reveals that the condition is false. Then the computer 
will finish executing the loop and immediately move on to the code written after it.

How can the ``condition`` be several times true-true-ture and then suddenly stop
being true? It's quite simple: the ``code`` can change variables upon whose values 
the condition relies, and the check will fail. Actually, this is the whole point 
of the process. (And if the ``code`` doesn't actually change anything, then
the ``condition`` will always be true, and you will get a so-called 
"infinite loop" — the program will hang. Don't do that.)

Particularly, it may occur that the loop condition will not be true 
from the very beginning. Then the loop will not be run even once, 
execution will immediately move on to instructions after the loop.

The entire shape of the loop essentially means "while the ``condition`` 
is true, do the ``code``".

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    n = int(input())
    a = 1
    while 2 * a < n:
        print(a)
        a += 1
    print("Done")

What does this code do? First, it reads the value of ``n`` from the keyboard.
For example, let's suppose the user entered 5. Next, 1 is written to the 
variable ``a``. And then the loop begins.

First, the computer checks whether ``2 * a < n`` is true.
Indeed, ``2 * a`` is 2, and ``n`` is 5, the condition is met.
Therefore, we begin executing the code that is written inside the loop.
Namely, we write ``a``, i.e. 1, on the screen. And add one to ``a``,
resulting ``a == 2``. We've moved to the end of the code 
(it's also called "the loop body"), so we check the condition again. 
It's still true (``2 * a`` is 4, and ``n`` is equal to 5), 
so we execute the loop body again. We display 2 on the screen
and again increase ``a`` by one. We check the condition again, it is
no longer met (``2*a`` is 6, and ``n`` is 5), the loop ends.

Once the loop is terminated, we move on to the code after it, printing "Done".

One more example, now quite sophisticated:
::

    n = int(input())
    a = 1
    while a < n:
        b = a
        while b > 0:
            if b % 2 == 1:
                print(b, end=" ")
            b -= 1
        print()
        a *= 2

Here is a loop put into another loop (nested loops). It works as follows: let's consider 
the user entered 6. The variable ``a``, just like above, becomes equal to 1.

The outer loop begins (which is ``while a < n``). The variable ``b``
becomes equal to ``a``, i.e. 1. While ``b > 0`` we do the following
(inner loop): if ``b`` is odd, then we display 1, after
which we reduce ``b`` by 1. As a result, 1 is displayed on the screen,
``b`` becomes 0 and the inner loop ends.

But the execution of the outer loop still continues. The ``print()`` insturction 
is executed, which outputs nothing, just starting a new line, and the variable ``a`` 
is  multiplied by 2 and becomes 2. Checking the loop condition: ``a`` is still 
less than ``n``. Therefore we repeat the operations, but with the new ``a`` value. 
Variable `b` becomes equal to 2 and the inner loop begins. In it, first (when
``b == 2``) output is not performed (because ``b`` is even), and ``b``
becomes equal to 1. Then 1 is output to the screen, ``b`` becomes equal
to 0 and the inner loop ends.

The outer loop continues, another empty line is output and ``a`` becomes
equal to 4. This is still less than ``n``, so we enter the inner loop again. 
Now ``b`` becomes equal to 4... and during the entire inner loop
on the screen is printed 3 1 (I will not describe it in detail).

Next, we output the new line again and ``a`` becomes equal to 8. This is
now more than ``n``, so the outer loop ends.

For loop
--------

The ``while`` loop works bluntly: it checks the condition and executes the code, 
and so on until the condition stops being true. This allows you to implement
almost any looping rules that are needed, and therefore is frequently used.

But besides, quite often it happens that you need to execute the
same code several times in a row, just changing the value of one variable
in some very simple way. There is a ``for`` loop for this. It is written
this way:

::

    for variable in list_values:
        code

This loop works like this: the ``variable`` is assigned the first
value is from the ``list_values`` and the ``code`` is executed.
Then it is assigned the next value from that list and the ``code`` is executed
again, and so on.

Example:
::

    for i in 7, 42, 137:
        print(i)

This code will output all three specified numbers (7, 42 and
137), one after another.

The list of values can be set as in the example above, separated by commas,
or in variety of other ways. You will learn the general rules of this later,
while I will just give the common way that you will often 
use now (and the one with an explicit listing of values,
as above, you will need quite rarely).

So, very often you need to change the loop variable by going through 
the numbers in a certain range one after another, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4,
..., 10. There is a ``range`` operation for this. It is written like this:
``for i in range(1, 11)`` — this iterates through all the numbers from 1
(first bound is included) to 11 (but **second bound is not included**),
i.e. just the range of numbers written above.
Once again, because it is important: the first number is included, the last
is not included. Example:
::

    for i in range(1, 21):
        print(i, "*", i, "=", i * i)

This code will output a sequence of squares of all numbers from 1 to 20
including right endpoint (or up to 21 not including it).

You are free to omit the first parameter of ``range``, it will be
implicitly considered zero:: ``for i in range(4)`` will result in 0, 1, 2, 3.
This may seem odd and inconsistent, but in the next section (about arrays) 
you will understand that this is quite native.

Conversely, you can laso specify the third parameter for ``range`` — that
will be the step with which the value of the variable will change. For example, 
``range(1, 7, 2)`` means "from 1 (including it) to 7 (not including it) with step of 2", i.e.
gives the numbers 1, 3, 5. And ``range(0, 100, 10)`` gives the numbers 0, 10, 20, 30,
..., 90.

This third parameter is also used in a special way to iterate through the numbers 
in reverse order. ``range(10, 0, -1)`` gives 10, 9, 8, ..., 1.
Note that 0 is not included again. (Similarly, you can specify step equal to -2, etc.)

Of course, in ``range`` you can use variables, expressions, etc.
For example, ``range(a - b, a + b + 1)`` will iterate through the numbers from ``a-b`` to
``a+b`` including (up to ``a+b+1`` not including it).

And finally — a more complex example of using the ``for`` loop:
::

    for i in range(1, 10):
        for j in range(1, 10):
            print(i * j, end="")
        print()

this will output the multiplication table .

Break and continue
------------------

There are two special statements really useful for work with loops:
``break`` and ``continue``. Here I will describe what they do and
their basic appications.

Loop body and iterations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, I will set/remind a few terms that are useful on the topic of loops.

The **body** of the loop is actually those instructions that are written inside
the loop. For example, in the loop
::

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a = i * i
        print(i, a)
    
the loop body consists of two instructions: assignment and output.

The **iteration** is one separate pass the through the loop body.
During the loop execution instructions of the loop body are repeated several times 
— each such repetition is called an iteration. In the example above, we can say that
the loop will do *n* iterations. For example, you can say that on the fifth
iteration of the loop, the string "5 25" will be output.

Break statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``break`` statement is used to interrupt the execution of the loop body 
and go on to execute the code that comes after the loop. I.e. if at some
point you decided that you don't need to loop anymore, as your loop has
already produced all necessary data, and you need to move on to what is 
written after it, then write ``break`` in that point. Note that if the break 
happens in the middle of an iteration, this iteration will be interrupted 
and the loop body will not be executed until the end.

Example:
::

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        print('Tried', i, ', failed')
    print('The end!')

As soon as the condition is met, the corresponding *i* will be
output to the screen, and the execution of the loop will be interrupted 
immediately after that. Then, "The end!" will be displayed, and etc. 
In this case, the line "Tried..." will be output for every i 
**not including** the one on which the condition was met.

For example, for ``n == 9`` the output will be as follows:
::
    
    Tried 2 , failed
    3
    The end!

(Though this particular code would be easier to write 
via ``while`` loop. Think of how to do that)

The ``break`` statement can also be used with ``while`` and 
``repeat`` loops, one of the examples will be shown below.

Continue statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``continue`` statement is used to interrupt the execution of 
the current iteration of the loop and start the next iteration.
I.e., it's like jumping to the beginning of the loop without completing
what is written below in the body of the loop *but* with performing 
all the actions that must be performed after any iteration —
i.e. in the ``for`` loop increasing the value of the loop counter by 1,
and in ``while``/``repeat`` loops checking the condition and,
if it is not true, interrupting the whole loop.

Example::

    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i != 0:
            print('Tried', i, ', failed')
            continue
        print(n, 'is evelny divisible by', i)

Here the loop will go through all the numbers from ``2`` to ``n-1`` and for each will output
whether ``n`` is divisible by ``i`` or not. For example, for ``n == 9`` the output will look so::

    Tried 2 , failed
    9 is evenly divisible by 3
    Tried 4 , failed
    ...
    Tried 8 , failed

Let's look at the few first iterations in more detail. First, ``i`` becomes
equal to 2. We check: ``9 % 2 != 0``, so we go inside our ``if``. We output
"Tried..." to the screen, and then there's the ``continue`` statement. So we 
immediately start the next iteration: increase ``i`` (!), it becomes 
equal to 3, and we go to the beginning of the loop body. ``9 % 3 == 0``, so we 
don't execute the ``if`` body and output "9 is evenly divisible by 3".
This iteration is over. We increase `i` and go to the next one. And so on.

Of course, in this particular case it's possible to do without using 
``continue``, just by writing ``else`` after ``if``. That would be easier. 
But it happens that you need to sort out the numbers, and there are many 
specific conditions upon those you don't need to take the number into account.
Then writing a bunch of ``else`` statements would be much more complicated than
a few ``continue`` statements. For example (this one is rather synthetic,
but similar cases really exist)::

    for i in range(n):
        # we don' need numbers divisible by 5
        if i % 5 == 0:
            continue
        # we also don't need numbers that give remainder 4 when divided by 7
        # note that we may process something befоre checking the condition from the comment above
        p = i * i
        if p % 7 == 4:
            continue
        # all the remaining numbers are necessary
        # so here we do some complex processing with many instructions
        ...

Here it's way more clear what you meant than if you wrote it using ``else``. 
With ``else``, whoever is going to read your code would have to look where
``else`` ends, and whether there are some more instructions after that ``else``.
In contrast, here everything is clear: if ``if`` is executed, the
remaining part of the loop body is entirely skipped.

While True and break
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One special case of ``break`` statement usage is the following.
It's typical that you need to repeat some sequence of operations
and you want to check the exit condition *in the middle* of this
sequence. For example, you need to read numbers from keyboard
until zero is entered. All numbers, except zero, need to be
processed somehow (It's not essential here how exactly.
To simplify, we will just output them to the screen).

The natural way to do this looks like this::

    read a number
    if it's equal to zero, stop and exit
    output the number to the screen
    read a number
    if it's equal to zero, stop and exit
    output the number to the screen
    read a number
    if it's equal to zero, stop and exit
    output the number to the screen
    ...

The looping pattern seems quite clear, but if you try to write 
a loop without using ``break``, nothing good would come of that.

You'll probably take one of the several options. For example, like this:
::

    a = int(input())
    while a != 0:
        print(a)
        a = int(input())
        
In fact, you've "cut off" the looping sequence at the monent where 
the check must be performend and, as a result, were forced
to duplicate the reading operation: you have it before the loop, and
then again at the end of the loop. Code duplication is not very good
(if you have to change it, you may forget that the same code is in two
places); if you have a slightly more complex code instead of reading a number, 
it will be even worse. This particular variant, also has another disadvantage:
variable ``a`` has different values within one iteration of the loop. 
It would be easier if each iteration of the loop
corresponded to processing a certain entered number.

The second option you may come up with may be similar to this:
::

    a = 1
    while a != 0:
        a = int(input())
        if a != 0:
            print(a)

This one is better, as each iteration only processes one number, 
but it still has drawbacks. First, there is an artificial instruction 
``a = 1`` before the loop. Second, the condition ``a != 0``
is duplicated; if you have to change it, you may forget that it
is used twice. Third, you are going through ``if`` body in the *main* 
branch of the loop execution (i.e. the branch on which most iterations 
will be executed). This is not very convenient (from the point of readability): 
after all, all the numbers except the last one will not be zeros. 
So I would better write code which wouldn't require almost every iteration
to step into ``if`` for handling a rare case of ``a == 0``.
It would be much easier to read (especially if the processing would be 
not just ``print(a)``, but a much more complex code including 
several ``if``-statements itself and etc.).

Finally, you can implement it in this way:

::

    while 0 == 0:
        a = int(input())
        if a == 0:
            break
        print(a)

The artificial expression ``0 == 0`` is a condition that is always true: 
we need ``while`` to execute infinitely, and only stop via ``break``.
In fact, Python has a special word ``True`` in its syntax, denoting a condition
that is always true (and a symmetric word ``False`` denoting a condition 
that is never true). Accordingly, it's even better to type ``while True:``...

This option is free from all the disadvantages mentioned above.
Each iteration works with one number, reading code is not duplicated,
the check is not duplicated, the overall sequence of operations is clear,
the main branch of the loop goes straight through the main code.

This is how you should write any loops where the you need to check 
the condition *in the middle* of loop body:
::

    while True:
        some processing
        if exit_condition:
            break
        some more processing

Sample problems and solutions
-----------------------------

Here are a few sample problems similar to those you may come across on contests and in my course.

.. task::

    There are :math:`N` students in the class. On a PE lesson the teacher says "count off one to two".
    Output what the students will say.

    **Input**: One integer number — the number of students in the class.

    **Output**: A sequence of numbers 1 and 2 in the order corresponding to what students will say.

    **Example**:

    Input::

        5

    Output::

        1
        2
        1
        2
        1
    |
    |
    |

Firstly, of course, we read :math:`N`::

    n = int(input())

The most important thing in problems on the topic of loops is to understand 
what operation(s) will be repeated, how many times or upon what condition,
and what each repetition (iteration) of the cycle will correspond to.
In this problem, it's more or less clear: we need to print a number :math:`N` times, 
and each iteration will correspond to one student's answer. 
Therefore, it's reasonable to write a loop ``for i in range(n)``
which will give exactly :math:`N` repetitions.

Then we need to understand what to do inside each repetition. 
Here we have to decide what to output (1 or 2) and accordingly 
output it. In our ``for`` loop, we have the variable ``i`` 
in which the number of the current student is stored.
(This is a very important point — inside the loop you have to 
write code that will work in a generic way on each iteration, 
and usually it's a good point to rely on some variables representing 
the current state. In the ``for`` loop it's usually the looping variable.)

Here it's clear that the number we need to output depends on the parity of ``i``.
We should also take into account that the iteration interval (``range(n)``)
starts with zero. So the whole code will be such as given::

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(2)

.. task::

    :math:`N` numbers are given. Count how many of them are even.

    **Input**: On the first line there's one number :math:`N`.
    On the following :math:`N` lines there are given numbers — 
    one number on each line.

    **Output**: Print the quantity of even numbers.

    **Example**:

    Input::

        4
        10
        11
        12
        13

    Output::

        2
    |
    |
    |
    
Here you are faced with the fact that you don't know in advance 
(at the stage of writing the program) how many numbers you'll have to read.
First, the number :math:`N` will be entered, and after that :math:`N` more numbers. 
I.e. if 3 is input as the first number, then there will be 3 more numbers following,
and if 137 is input as the first number, there will be 137 more numbers. 
This is radically different from what you did before,
when you knew, for example, that exactly 6 numbers are always entered.

But loops are exactly the thing allowing you to repeat some operation certain times, 
and at the stage of writing the program it's not necessary to know how many times 
you need to do it. In the example above, you've output data inside the loop, and here, 
according to the task, you will have to *read* data inside the loop.

First, you read :math:`N`::

    n = int(input())

Then you need a loop iterating :math:`N` times and reading numbers inside it::

    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        ...

Then each number must be checked if it's even: ``if x % 2 == 0``. If so,
the even numbers counter should be increased by one.
Obviously, you need to create such a counter beforehand.

Finally you'll get::

    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        if x % 2 == 0:
            k += 1
    print(k)

Note that the output of the answer (``k``) is outside the loop so
``print`` doesn't have an indent.

.. task::

    Calculate the sum: :math:`1+2+3+\ldots+N`.

    **Input**: One integer number :math:`N`.

    **Output**: Print the required sum.

    **Example**:

    Input::

        2

    Output::

        3

    Input::

        5

    Output::

        15
    |
    |
    |

(Of course, this problem can be solved in one line via a 
well-known formula, but let's do it with a loop)

(Note as well: input 2 is correct and gives the answer 3 despite the fact 
that both two, three and :math:`N` are written in the formula.
This is a standard feature of such mathematical notation: in a formula 
with an ellipsis, more terms are written for the logic to be clear, 
but if :math:`N` is small, then only as many terms as necessary remain.

In such a problem, it is useful to think about how you'd count 
the answer "by hand". A typical answer is: I would just add up all the numbers!
But if you think about it, you'll realize you can't add up five numbers at once.
You will probably add the them in turn:
first add 2 to 1, then add 3 to the result,
then add 4 to the result, and etc.

Thus, a pattern emerges: you repeat one operation many times. 
This operation is addition of the next number to the current sum.
So first, we obviously need a loop iterating over the numbers one by one, 
second, we clearly need a variable for the current sum, let it be :math:`k`.
Accordingly, it's something like this::

    for i in .....:
        ... k + i

i.e. you need to add т.е. :math:`i` to :math:`k`.
But there's no point in just adding, you need to save the result somewhere.
And here's the trick may not be obvious: the result must be assigned to :math:`k` itself!
Because on the next iteration of the loop you'll need to add next :math:`i` exactly to this result::

    for i in .....:
        k = k + i

All that's left is to understand what are the bounds of the loop
and what should be the initial value of :math:`k`.
A typical option you may come up with is to initialize :math:`k` with 1 
(the first summand), and to organize a loop from 2 to :math:`N`.
But in fact it is a little easier to initially assign 0 to :math:`k`
(an empty sum, as if there are no summands at all),
and do the loop do from 1 to :math:`N` (of course, 
including :math:`N`, so you need to use ``range(1, n + 1)``).

So here's the entire code with the input and output::

    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        k = k + i
    print(k)
    
.. task::
    Masha wants to save up for a new phone. The phone costs :math:`N` rubles.
    Masha can save :math:`K` rubles a day and does it every day except Sunday,
    when she spends her money going to the cinema.
    Masha starts saving on Monday. In how many days will she get the required amount?

    **Input**: Two numbers :math:`N` and :math:`K`.

    **Output**: Print the number of days Masha needs.

    **Example**:

    Input::

        100 50

    Output::

        2

    Input::

        100 10

    Output::

        11
    |
    |
    |

In theory, it's not diificult to solve it with a formula and no loops
(but most likely with an ``if``, maybe not only one). But let's work out a loop.

We'll try to replicate how the amount of Masha's saved money will increase.
Let's denote the current sum as :math:`s`. Every day except Sunday :math:`K` 
is added to it. It's reasonable to write a loop where one iteration 
corresponds to one day. The loop should be executed until 
the required amount is reached, so it is natural to use ``while`` loop::

    while s < n:

What shoud we do inside the loop? Add :math:`K` to :math:`s`... 
but only if the current day is not Sunday::

    while s < n:
        if .....:  # here must be a "not Sunday" condition
            s = s + k

How can we get if today's Sunday or not? Naturally, we need some kind of day counter,
we'll then also use it to output the answer. Let's create a variable :math:`day` which
will represent the number of the current day. Masha starts saving on Monday. Considering 
it's  day 1, we easily get that Sundays are days whose numbers are evenly divided by 7.

The code will look like this::

    day = 1
    s = 0
    while s < n:
        if day % 7 != 0:
            s = s + k
        day = day + 1

Here's an only trouble left: the loop terminates already after moving to the next day,
i.e. in this code :math:`day` will be always greater than we need by 1.
Therefore, when we output the answer, you we to subtract 1::

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    day = 1
    s = 0
    while s < n:
        if day % 7 != 0:
            s = s + k
        day = day + 1
    print(day - 1)
