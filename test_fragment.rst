Body of the conditional statement
---------------------------------

"Body" of any complex statement (yet now you only know about ``if``)
consists of other statements which are executed inside it. You can put there
any set of statements you wish. The only requierment is to write them with an indent
so that Python interpreter would understand them as a part of ``if``-statement,
not a resumption of the main program body.

Example::

    ...
    if a == 0:
        print("Zero")
        b = int(input())
        if b == 0:
            print("That's also zero!")
        print("-----")

Please note that you cat put an ``if``-statement inside of another ``if``-statement,
and its body will accordingly need an additional indent. In this example,
``print("That's also zero!")`` will be executed only if ``b`` is also equal to zero
but ``print("-----")`` will run regardless of ``b`` value (but of course it needs ``a`` to be zero).

Once again, as stated in the previous section: Python, as any other programming language,
is a constructor. Actually, programming is the assembly of a big program from small "bricks"
which are statements. So you can use any of these bricks inside of the ``if``-statement.
